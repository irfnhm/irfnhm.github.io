title: Missing Pieces in Machine Intelligence
---

The idea of machines that operate on the principles of the human brain has been around for more than fifty years. So, the Machine Learning approaches we have are based on the understanding of how the brain works and how it solves problems. We cannot just mimic one area of brain to achieve almost **Human level Intelligence**.

For example, we cannot only focus on the **cerebral cortex** which contains the Neocortex responsible for higher functions such as sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and in humans, language, and at the same time we are skipping the limbic system which has the Hippocampus- center of emotion, memory, and the autonomic nervous system.

So, to achieve more in Machine Intelligence, we have to completely simulate the Human Brain with extreme flexibility. The two areas of brain; Neocortex and Hippocampus must be the main benchmark for Machine Learning. Humans can learn to do new things and solve new types of problems no matter what complexity, on a vast level. To build intelligent machines with equal flexibility, we need to understand the fundamental principles, our brain uses to achieve this remarkable ability.

So, our approach to solve intelligence has to be Unique. We need to deeply understand the Human Brain, the way it learns and adopts to new things and then put those abilities into the Machine Software. And we have to believe that focus on flexibility, learning from the brain is the path to Machine Intelligence.
