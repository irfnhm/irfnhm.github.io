title: Online bootcamp for engineering students in Kashmir who have been affected by 1 year long Internet shutdown
---

It's been now a year since internet access was blocked in Kashmir by the Indian Govt. Our students face challenges in preparing for their exams, interviews, projects and even keeping the pace with the changing tech world. Especially the folks in computer science who are in their 3rd or 4th years of their engineering courses have been affected the most. 

I am working in the industry for 5 years now and I will try to use my knowledge and skills to help and train these students for their job interviews. Tech interviews are very challenging, and with these internet shutdowns these students will face difficulties. This is where I want to help.

The bootcamp will run for 3 months and I will design the course to cover as much as is needed to ace these interviews. The areas and technologies I will help are:

<ol>
<li>Basic and Advanced C++</li>
<li>PHP for developing web applications</li>
<li>System Design</li>
<li>Cloud computing using Amazon Web Services</li>
<li>Interview Preparation using Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
</ol>

I have carefully chosen these areas based on my experience in hiring new engineers straing out of college.

Since I am doing this out of love for my people, this is a lot of effort and time from my side. I want to be assured that the group I am helping values the time I spend on this. So I will be chosing people based on a simple assessment. This will make sure I have right people to focus on.

The entire bootcamp will be online, here the guidelines:
<ol>
<li>Training will be live on Zoom/Google/Skype or anything that works for all, with weekly assignments.</li>
<li>There will be weekly exams where I will review all the coding assignments.</li>
<li>I won't stress you out, we will be playing games besides learning. That's also important.</li>
</ol>

## Important
This bootcamp is only for people studying in engineering colleges based in Kashmir.
